  <p> TurtleCorp Studio, a small group of students from ELAM, in East London. Our new game that is coming out is Wars Ruin. A game focusing on the recovery from a war and the problems caused by it. This game will not only be about a daring adventure in a realistic war torn world, but also about an educational, meaningful story about the impacts of war. You will be playing as an abandoned soldier in a hostile and damaged environment, full of distrust and hate. You will be on a journey to find a purpose in life when all is lost and facing your greatest fears. Follow us on this quest of completing this game! </p>

	<h1> Let the research begin! #001 </h1>
	<p> It is the beginning of the 10 weeks of production of the game! The first 3 weeks will just be pre-production elements. So far we have been researching into different sources for the artstyle and gameplay mechanics. We brainstormed through the storylines and character backgrounds followed by looking at the ideas for level maps. We are aiming to add as many interactive elements in game as much as possible.<p> We also completed our reference image moodboard and got started on storyboarding, additionally we also started to work on thematic research so that the game would consist of information that would allow the players to understand the concept better. <p> We also started our instagram page! We will be posting regular updates over there @warsruin about the game and what have we been recently up to. <p> More things to be done next week, stay tuned!</p>
